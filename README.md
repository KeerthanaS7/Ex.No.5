# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim:
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: AI TOOLS(CHAT GPT)

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.


# OUTPUT

## NAIVE PROMPT : 
A short, vague, or generic instruction without detailed context or structure.
Characteristics : 
- Minimal detail
- Open-ended
- Lacks clear constraints
- Model must guess intent
## BASIC PROMPT :
A clear, detailed, and structured prompt that gives specific instructions, context, and expectations to guide the AI.
Characteristics :
- Provides context
- Defines format/length
- Specifies tone or style
- Includes role or audience

## SCENARIO 1 : CREATIVE STORY GENERATION

NAIVE PROMPT : “Write a story about a dragon.”
OUTPUT :
There was a dragon living in a cave. Everyone was afraid of it, but one day a brave boy entered the cave and found the dragon was lonely. They became friends and lived happily ever after.

BASIC PROMPT : 

“Write a 250-word creative story about a lonely dragon who discovers friendship through a lost traveler. Use a whimsical and emotional tone, describe their surroundings vividly, and end with a moral lesson.”

OUTPUT : 
High in the misty hills, a dragon named Zephyra guarded a valley filled with emerald trees and silver rivers. For centuries, her only company was the echo of her own roar. One rainy night, a lost traveler stumbled upon her cave, trembling but kind. Instead of breathing fire, Zephyra offered warmth. Together, they watched the storm fade into dawn, learning that friendship can grow even in the unlikeliest hearts. When the traveler left, Zephyra no longer felt alone; her roar now carried laughter instead of sorrow.
Moral: Loneliness fades when kindness finds a way in.

## SCENARIO 2 - Answering a Factual Question
NAIVE PROMPT : “Tell me about the moon.”

OUTPUT : The moon is a round object that moves around Earth. It shines at night and affects tides. People have visited it.

BASIC PROMPT : “Explain what the Moon is in about 120 words. Include its formation, phases, and importance to Earth. Maintain a scientific and factual tone.”

OUTPUT : The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite, formed about 4.5 billion years ago when a Mars-sized body collided with Earth, ejecting debris that later coalesced into the Moon. It orbits Earth approximately every 27 days, showing phases — new, crescent, quarter, gibbous, and full — caused by the changing angles of sunlight. The Moon influences ocean tides due to its gravitational pull, stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt, and affects our planet’s climate. Its surface bears craters, mountains, and plains of solidified lava, offering vital clues about early solar system history.

## SCENARIO 3 - Summarizing a Concept
NAIVE PROMPT : “Summarize Artificial Intelligence.”

OUTPUT : Artificial Intelligence is when computers do things that normally require humans. It’s used in many fields like healthcare and education.

Basic Prompt:“Summarize Artificial Intelligence (AI) in about 100 words. Include its definition, main types (Narrow and General AI), and one real-world application. Use a formal academic tone.”

OUTPUT : 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning and reasoning. AI is classified into Narrow AI, which performs specific functions like voice recognition, and General AI, which aims to replicate full human cognition. A common real-world application is autonomous vehicles, which use sensors and algorithms to navigate safely. AI continues to revolutionize industries, increasing efficiency while raising important ethical considerations about automation and human employment.

## Scenario 4 – Providing Advice or Recommendations

Naïve Prompt:“How can I study better?”

OUTPUT : You can study better by focusing more, avoiding distractions, and practicing regularly.

Basic Prompt:

“Give five evidence-based study tips for college students. Focus on time management, memory improvement, and reducing procrastination. Present each tip in 1–2 sentences with clear, actionable advice.”

OUTPUT : 
1. Plan with purpose: Use a weekly planner to allocate focused study sessions, breaking tasks into smaller, achievable goals.
2. Apply spaced repetition: Review material over increasing intervals to strengthen long-term memory retention.
3. Use active recall: Test yourself instead of rereading notes to enhance learning efficiency.
4. Minimize distractions: Study in a quiet, dedicated space and keep your phone out of reach.
5. Reward consistency: Pair study goals with small rewards to maintain motivation and reduce procrastination.
  

# RESULT: The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully
